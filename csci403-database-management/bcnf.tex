    \section{Definitions}
    \subsection{Superkey}
    A subset $X$ of attributes of $R$: no two tuples of $R$ will ever agree on
    $X$.\\
    If $a$ is a superkey $a \rightarrow \{a, b, \dots\}$

    \subsection{Functional Dependency (FD)}
    If it is always true that whenever two tuples agree on $X$, they also agree
    on $Y$, then $X \rightarrow Y$.

    \textbf{Example}: \{instructor\} \textrightarrow \{office, email\}

    \textbf{Trivial FD}: An FD is \textit{trivial} if $Y \subseteq X$, then $X
    \rightarrow Y$\\
    \textbf{Non-trivial FD}: And FD is \textit{non-trivial} if $X \rightarrow Y$
    but $Y \not\subseteq X$.

    \subsection{Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)}
    A relation $R$ is a \textbf{Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)} if for every
    non-trivial functional dependency $X \rightarrow A$ on $R$, $X$ is a superkey of
    $R$.

    \textbf{Example}: Clearly, instructor is not a superkey of the relation.
    Therefore, we say that the FD \{instructor\} \textrightarrow \{office\}
    \textit{violates} BCNF, and the relation schema is not BCNF.

    \subsection{Closures}
    Given some set of FDs $F$ on a relation schema $R$, and some subset of
    attributes $A$, then the set $\{B_i : A \rightarrow B_i \}$ is called the
    \textit{closure} of $A$ and is denoted $A^+$.

    \section{Decomposition Algorithm}
    while some relation schema is not in BCNF: \\
    \tab choose some relation schema $R$ not in BCNF \\
    \tab choose some FD $X \rightarrow Y$ on $R$ that violates BCNF \\
    \tab (optional) expand $Y$ so that $Y = X^{+}$ (closure of $X$) \\
    \tab let $Z$ be all attributes of $R$ not included in $X$ or $Y$ \\
    \tab replace $R$ with two new relations \\
    \tab\tab $R_1$, containing attributes ${X, Y}$ \\
    \tab\tab $R_2$, containing attributes ${X, Z}$

    Note, this algorithm is \textbf{\textit{not}} deterministic - you can decompose
    differently if you choose differently

    \section{Decomposition Notes}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The final step above is accomplished simply by projection onto the
            attributes in $R_1$ and $R_2$. (Recall that this may result in fewer
            tuples.)

        \item After decomposing, you will need to establish which FDs now apply to
            $R_1$ and $R_2$ as well as determine their superkeys, in order to
            determine if they are now in BCFN.

        \item The optional step of expanding $Y$ is recommended, as it tends to
            result in fewer larger relation schemas, and may reduce the problem
            faster - e.g. consider decomposing instructor \textrightarrow office.
    \end{itemize}

    \section{Decomposition Example}
    Let's use the relation schema in Figure 1 as an example.

    For this schema, we listed the following FDs:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item instructor \textrightarrow office (violates BCNF)
        \item instructor \textrightarrow email (violates BCNF)
        \item \{course id, section\} \textrightarrow instructor (does not violate
            BCNF)
        \item course id \textrightarrow title (violates BCNF)
    \end{itemize}

    What superkeys do we have?

    Answer: any superset of our only key, which is \{course id, section\}.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Let's pick our first violating FD to work with first: instructor
            \textrightarrow office
        \item Next, expand the RHS as much as possible (we want the closure of
            instructor)

            \begin{center}
                instructor \textrightarrow \{instructor, office, email\}
            \end{center}
        \item Now we decompose into two new tables, shown in the next slide:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item $R_1 = \pi_{instructor,\ office,\ email}(R)$
                \item $R_2 = \pi_{instructor,\ course\ id,\ section,\ title}(R)$
            \end{itemize}
        \item Now table $R_1$ is in BCNF (note that this is not guaranteed by the
            algorithm -- we could have had other violating FDs)
        \item Table $R_2$ has a violating FD though: course id \textrightarrow title
        \item Decomposition of $R_2$ via course id \textrightarrow title:
            \[\text{course\_id}^+ = \{\text{course\_id, title}\}\]
        \item Decompose into
            \[R_3 = \pi_{\text{course\_id, title}}(R_2)\]
            \[R_4 = \pi_{\text{instructor, course\_id, title}}(R_2)\]
        \item Done!
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Three tables remain: $R_1$, $R_3$, $R_4$
                \item All non-essential redundancy has been removed
                \item Each table now represents a fundamental entity
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item $R_1$ = instructor info
                        \item $R_3$ = course info
                        \item $R_4$ = section info
                    \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

    \section{Correctness of Decomposition}
    Two requirements for correct decomposition so that we can recover original
    relation from decomposition using natural joins

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item natural join of decomposition must contain all attributes of the
            original relation
        \item lossless join property: natural join of decomposition relations
            results in exactly the same tuples we had before decomposition
    \end{enumerate}

    \section{Multivalued Dependencies (MVD)}
    \textbf{Def:} An MVD $X \twoheadrightarrow Y$ exists on a relation $R$ if
    whenever there are two tuples $t_1$ and $t_2$ which agree on attribute $X$, then
    there also exists a tuple $t_3$ (which could be $t_1$ or $t_2$) such that the
    following are true:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $t_3[x] = t_1[x] = t_2[x]$
        \item $t_3[y] = t_2[y]$
        \item $t_3[z] = t_1[z]$ where $z$ is everything in $R$ \textit{not} in $X$
            and $Y$.
    \end{enumerate}

    By symmetry, there must also exist $t_4$ with $t_4[x] = t_1[x]$, $t_4[y] =
    t_4[y]$, $t_4[z] = t_2[z]$.

    \section{Inference Rules}
    Allow us to infer additional FDs from an existing set of FDs
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Splitting rule}: If $A \rightarrow \{B_1, B_2\}$ then $A
            \rightarrow B_1$ and $A \rightarrow B_2$
        \item \textbf{Combining rule}: If $A \rightarrow B$ and $A \rightarrow
            C$ then $A \rightarrow \{B, C\}$
        \item \textbf{Transitive Rule}: If $A \rightarrow B$ and $B \rightarrow
            C$, then $A \rightarrow C$
    \end{itemize}
\end{multicols*}
